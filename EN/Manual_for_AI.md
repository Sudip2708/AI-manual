### 1. Introduction to AI

###### 1.1 What is AI

**What is AI**
---
Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is a field of computer science that focuses on creating systems 
capable of "thinking" or at least performing tasks that would normally require human intelligence. 
This includes technologies like machine learning, neural networks, and algorithms that learn from data and experience. 
Think of AI as a digital assistant that continuously improves and learns how to best assist you. 
It could be a chatbot answering your questions, a program recognizing faces in photos, 
or even a system analyzing massive amounts of data to identify patterns that humans might miss.

**History and Development of AI**
---
AI has its roots in the 1950s when scientists first started exploring the idea that machines could think. 
Since then, AI has come a long way—from simple rule-based systems that responded 
to predefined stimuli to today’s complex models that can improve themselves and learn new things. 
In the 21st century, AI has exploded into many areas of life, from natural language processing to self-driving cars. 
AI has become an integral part of our world, offering tremendous opportunities 
but also presenting significant challenges.

**Importance of AI**
---
AI is crucial today not only for technological advancement but also for improving quality of life. 
Imagine having an assistant that can help you at any time—whether you need to write an email, 
translate a text into another language, or even analyze financial data. 
AI assists doctors in diagnosing diseases, helps scientists discover new medicines, 
and enhances the efficiency of businesses and households. 
Its potential goes even further—AI can tackle problems previously thought unsolvable, 
such as combating climate change or developing personalized medicine. 
Therefore, understanding AI and learning how to use it effectively is essential.

###### 1.2 Why was AI created?

**Limitations of Traditional Programming**
---
In the past, when people wanted to create a program that could evaluate data and perform various operations, 
they had to input all the parameters manually. This meant that every step of the computation 
had to be precisely programmed, and all possible solutions had to be predefined, 
which was time-consuming and impractical. This approach worked for simpler tasks, 
but for more complex systems, such as weather forecasting, 
it was nearly impossible to provide enough data and process it efficiently.

**Fulfilling the Desire to Communicate with Computers in Natural Language**
---
AI addresses this problem by using techniques that allow computers to learn 
and process information similarly to how humans do. Instead of manually programming every step of an algorithm, 
AI focuses on creating models that learn from available data to recognize patterns and make decisions. 
AI is an advanced tool designed by humans to enable communication with computers in natural language. 
This means the computer can understand your questions and provide relevant answers based on available information.

[*Back to Contents*](#contents)

---

###### 1.3 Why should I want to use AI?

**How it Used to Be**
---
Artificial intelligence is a modern tool that changes the way we approach searching for and working with information. 
In the past, when you searched for something on the internet, you entered a keyword into a search engine 
and received a list of links to websites where the answer to your query might be found. 
You then had to browse the sites yourself, read through them, and search for relevant information, 
often having to sift through a lot of irrelevant content to find what you needed. 
This process could be time-consuming and frustrating.

**How It Works Today**
---
AI offers a completely different approach. Instead of just providing you with links to pages, 
AI can analyze the content of those pages (reads them for you) and then summarize the most important information 
in human language. AI can extract the essence from long texts and present it to you in a compact 
and understandable form, saving you time and effort. It's like asking a knowledgeable friend 
who has access to all the information available on the internet and can easily and clearly pass it on to you.

**AI Excels at Understanding Languages**
---
AI understands your native language, and it doesn’t even mind if your writing or speaking isn't grammatically perfect. 
It can grasp even complex linguistic nuances and ensure that your communication is as accurate as possible. 
It also has the ability to stylistically and grammatically analyze and correct your text 
or adapt it to certain conditions based on your specifications and requirements.

**AI Keeps Track of What You’re Discussing**
--- 
The greatest advantage of AI, however, is the ability to converse. 
AI can track the context of your discussion, which means it remembers previous questions 
and answers and can build on them. You can ask follow-up questions if the answer isn’t clear 
or if you want to explore a topic further. You can also inquire about other perspectives 
and develop your ideas more effectively.

**AI is Here to Enhance Everyday Activities**
---
This approach to information is faster, more organized, and allows you to get exactly the answers 
you need without unnecessary searching. Besides processing information, AI can help you organize tasks, 
remind you of important deadlines, or even assist with creating creative content. 
In addition to simplifying information management, AI offers many other benefits 
that you can utilize in both your personal and professional life, 
whether you need help completing a specific task, planning, or just looking for inspiration.

### 1. Introduction to AI

###### 1.4 What AI Definitely Is Not

**AI Does Not Have Consciousness**
---
AI is not a self-thinking entity acting on its own, and it certainly does not intend to eradicate humanity, 
even though it may sometimes appear that way in movies. AI is not alive and does not have consciousness. 
It is merely a very sophisticated tool created by humans to make their work easier. 
So if AI seems lifelike to you, it is primarily due to the developers' excellent work 
and extensive training on a large amount of data.

**AI Is Not Perfect**
---
Although AI can provide very accurate and useful answers, it is not infallible. 
AI operates based on the data it was trained on, and its responses may sometimes be inaccurate, 
misleading, or incomplete. Additionally, AI does not have the ability to understand context 
to the same extent as a human, which can lead to misunderstandings. 
Therefore, it is important to always critically evaluate the results AI provides 
and verify them with additional sources if necessary.

**AI Is Not a Replacement for Humans**
---
AI can automate many processes and provide quick answers, but it can never fully replace human creativity, 
empathy, or the ability to solve complex problems with deep understanding and intuition. 
AI is a tool that can complement human abilities, not replace them. 
In both professional and personal life, it is important to use AI as an assistant, 
not as a substitute for human judgment and experience.

### 2. Basics of Conversation

###### 2.1 The Importance of Friendly Interaction

**Why Start with a Friendly Greeting?**
---
When you start a conversation with AI, it’s good to establish a friendly tone. 
It may sound strange, but even though AI doesn’t have emotions, the way you communicate affects how it responds to you. 
When you initiate interaction in a friendly manner, AI is set up to respond in a more welcoming and understandable way, 
leading to a better experience for you. Think of a friendly greeting as an activator of a cooperative interface 
that helps you achieve your goals more easily.

**Influencing Results Based on Tone**
---
Your communication style can influence the kind of responses you get from AI. For example, 
if you’re in a hurry and ask short, blunt questions, AI might respond more briefly and with less detail. 
Conversely, if you have more time and ask thoughtful questions, AI may provide more detailed and precise answers. 
There’s no right or wrong approach; both have their pros and cons, depending on your situation 
and the type of answer you’re seeking.

**Examples of Inputs and Responses**
- **Friendly:** "Hi there, could you please help me with this task?"
- **Result:** "Of course! I’d be happy to help. What exactly do you need to know?"

- **Brief:** "I need a quick solution."
- **Result:** "Here’s a quick solution, but if you need more details, feel free to ask."

[*Back to Contents*](#contents)

---

###### 2.2 How to Ask Questions

**Clear and Specific Queries**
--- 
To get the most accurate answers from AI, it’s important to ask clear and specific questions. 
AI works with what you give it, so the more precise your question, the more precise the answer. 
If a question is vague, AI might interpret it differently than you intended. 
And if the question is too general, AI might offer a broader range of responses, 
which could lead to less useful results.

**Example:**
- **General:** "How to write an essay?"
- **Specific:** "How to write an essay on climate change focusing on renewable energy sources?"

**Follow-up Questions**
---
Don’t hesitate to combine questions if you need more information. 
You can start with a broader question and then ask for specific details. 
This allows you to better understand the topic and get a more relevant answer. 
This way, you can gradually refine your needs and guide AI toward the answers you’re looking for.

**Example:**
- "Can you explain what machine learning is?"
- "What are the most common types of machine learning algorithms?"
- "How does machine learning differ from deep learning?"

[*Back to Contents*](#contents)

---

###### 2.3 Handling Responses

**Evaluating Responses**
---
After receiving a response from AI, it’s good to evaluate it. 
AI tries to provide the best answer based on your inputs, but it’s useful to read the answer 
and think about whether it really meets your needs. If something is missing or unclear, 
don’t hesitate to ask another question.

**Requesting a Revision**
---
If the answer doesn’t seem accurate enough or if you need it adjusted, you can ask AI for a revision. 
AI can rework the answer, expand it, or simplify it according to your needs. 
This helps you get the most information and better understand the topic.

**Example:**
- "Could you elaborate on the benefits of machine learning?"
- "Could you explain this more simply, like for a beginner?"

[*Back to Contents*](#contents)

---

###### 2.4 Learning from Feedback

**Feedback for AI**
---
AI is constantly learning from your interactions, so when you provide feedback, you help it improve. 
If, for example, the answer didn’t meet your expectations, you can let AI know so that it provides 
a better answer next time. Conversely, if the answer was great, you can praise AI, 
which helps it better understand your preferences.

**Example:**
- "This is exactly what I needed! Thank you."
- "This answer wasn’t entirely accurate, could you clarify it?"

**How Feedback Improves AI**
---
Feedback is a key tool for improving AI. It helps AI better understand your needs 
and tailor its responses to your preferences. This way, you can teach AI to better respond 
to your specific requests and situations. The more feedback you provide, the more AI improves in its answers, 
in interacting with you, and in adapting to your work style.

### 3. Advanced Queries

###### 3.1 How to Obtain Accurate and Relevant Responses

**Why Does Accuracy Matter?**  
---
When working with AI, it is crucial to formulate your queries as precisely as possible to ensure 
the results align with what you truly need. AI processes vast amounts of information, 
and the more specific your query, the more accurate and relevant the responses you'll receive.

**Tips for Obtaining Accurate Answers:**  
- **Be Specific**: Instead of asking general questions, try to be as specific as possible so the AI can understand exactly what you're looking for.
- **Provide Context**: If you're asking about something complex, don't forget to provide context so the AI can better interpret your query.
- **Use Step-by-Step Queries**: If the topic is complex, try breaking the question down into smaller parts to get more precise information.

**Example Queries:**  
- "Can you find the latest unemployment statistics in the Czech Republic for the past year?"
- "What are the latest trends in artificial intelligence technology?"
- "What are the main advantages and disadvantages of working from home in terms of productivity?"

[*Back to Contents*](#contents)

---

###### 3.2 How to Utilize AI for More Complex Tasks

**How Does AI Handle Complex Tasks?**  
---
AI is capable of handling complex tasks that require a combination of multiple steps or deeper analysis. 
You can use it not just for simple queries but also for complex projects 
that would otherwise require more time and effort.

**Examples of Complex Tasks:**  
- **Project Planning**: AI can help you create a detailed plan, including timelines and resource allocation.
- **Data Analysis**: You can ask AI to process and interpret large datasets.
- **Presentation or Report Preparation**: AI can assist in organizing information and preparing a professional output.

**Example Queries:**  
- "Help me create a plan for launching a new product on the market."
- "Analyze this dataset and generate clear graphs from it."
- "Draft a final report based on the data we've collected."

It's important to note that commonly accessible AI has limited capabilities, especially regarding memory, 
so for more complex tasks, it is often advantageous to break down complex tasks into several simpler ones 
and gradually work towards the final result. It's good to experiment a little and explore 
the limits of the AI you're using.

[*Back to Contents*](#contents)

###### 3.3 Customizing AI for Specific Needs

**How to Customize AI for Specific Tasks?**  
---
AI is a flexible tool that can be customized to meet your specific needs. 
You can train it to better understand your work style, preferences, or specific tasks you repeatedly handle. 
This allows for even more efficient collaboration.

**Customization Options:**  
- **Setting Preferences**: You can configure AI to prefer a certain communication style or type of responses.
- **Automating Repetitive Tasks**: If you frequently perform similar tasks, AI can be set up to execute them automatically according to your instructions.
- **Learning from Your Interactions**: AI learns from each interaction and can improve its responses and suggestions based on how you work with it.

**Example Queries:**  
- "Can you focus on this type of task and adjust your responses according to my preferences?"
- "Automate these repetitive tasks for me to save time."
- "Remember this response style for future queries."

Keep in mind the limitations of freely accessible AI and its ability to retain specific instructions. 
It may happen that the agreed-upon rules are no longer followed over time. 
In such cases, simply remind the AI of the rules to restore their usage. 
If it's a routine task, such as translating multiple documents, 
it's a good idea to remind the AI of the translation rules before each query.

**How to Agree on Conversation Rules with AI**  
---
If, in a particular thread, you reach a point where AI, based on previous interactions and instructions, 
returns exactly the results you want, you can ask it to summarize the currently used rules or settings. 
The resulting text can then be used at the beginning of a new conversation, asking the AI to follow it.

**Example Queries:**  
- "Can you list everything we've agreed upon in this thread?"
- "Can you write a text for yourself that I could paste into a new thread to continue with the same settings?"
- "Can you tell me more about the options for transferring settings from one thread to another?"

[*Back to Contents*](#contents)

###### 3.4 How to Use AI for Breaking Down Tasks and Understanding Problems

**Why is Understanding the Task Important?**  
---
One of the key steps in solving any problem is correctly understanding the task. 
When faced with a task that seems complex or unclear, AI can help you break it down into smaller parts 
and explain what is expected of you. This will help you avoid unnecessary mistakes 
and better prepare for solving the task.

**Example Questions:**  
- "Please break down this task and explain what is being asked of me."
- "Can you explain this to me as if I were a child and provide some examples?"
- "Please divide this task into smaller parts and write out their specifics."

**How Does AI Help Understand Complex Problems?**  
---
AI can analyze the task text and identify key points you should focus on. 
If there's something you don't understand, AI can provide additional context 
or explain terminology you're unfamiliar with. This allows you to analyze the text more effectively 
and proceed with greater confidence. You can also ask AI to extract just the essential parts from a long text, 
saving you time reading unnecessary data.

**Example Questions:**  
- "Please list all the information related to this matter from this text."
- "Please rewrite this text into a list of topics it covers."
- "Please tell me what is key in this text and what I should focus on first."

[*Back to Contents*](#contents)

---

###### 3.5 Exploring Different Approaches to Problem-Solving

**Why is it Good to Know Multiple Approaches?**  
---
There is usually more than one way to solve most problems. 
AI can help you explore various methods and approaches you can use. 
This gives you a broader view of the problem and allows you to choose the approach that suits you best 
or is most effective in the given situation.

**Example Questions:**  
- "Is there more than one approach to solving this matter?"
- "What are the most commonly used approaches to solving this problem?"
- "Please list all possible approaches to solving this problem."

**Advantages and Disadvantages of Different Approaches**  
---
Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses. 
AI can help you weigh the pros and cons of each method so you can decide which approach is best for you. 
This might include factors such as time requirements, costs, complexity, or risk, 
as well as your ability and current situation to understand and solve the problem.

**Example Questions:**  
- "What are the advantages and disadvantages of the mentioned methods?"
- "What should I base my decision on?"
- "I find myself in this situation; what are the most suitable solutions and why?"

[*Back to Contents*](#contents)

---

###### 3.6 How to Develop the Ideal Process

**A Systematic Approach to Problem-Solving**  
---
AI can serve as a guide in creating a systematic process for solving a task. 
You can ask AI to develop a step-by-step plan to ensure you don't miss any important steps. 
This is especially useful when dealing with complex tasks that require detailed planning.

**Example:**  
- "What is the usual process for solving this situation, and what steps does it involve?"
- "Can you provide a step-by-step guide to achieving this goal?"
- "Can you elaborate more on step 2?"

**Iterative Improvement**  
---
After creating a plan, you can ask AI to review or improve the process. 
AI can suggest optimizations or alternative steps that might increase the efficiency of your approach. 
This ensures that your plan is as effective and well-suited to your needs as possible.

**Example:**  
- "Review this process and suggest any improvements."
- "Can we modify this plan to make it more efficient?"
- "Am I proceeding correctly?"

###### 3.7 Personal Creative Queries

**Developing Ideas with AI**  
---
Sometimes you have a great idea, but you need to develop it further or test it from different angles. 
AI can act as a creative partner, helping you expand your thoughts, explore alternative approaches, 
or come up with new ideas that hadn't occurred to you.

**Example Questions:**  
- "Can you expand on this idea and give me some examples of how it could work in practice?"
- "What are the possible ways to implement this idea?"
- "Here is my concept; can you think of anything else that would be good to add?"

**Exploring New Perspectives**  
---
AI can help you think "outside the box" and explore different perspectives. 
You can ask it to turn an idea upside down or combine it with other concepts, 
creating entirely new and interesting ideas.

**Example Questions:**  
- "Describe this process in reverse, as if time were moving backward."
- "Can you adjust this idea to fit this environment and describe it from this perspective?"
- "What would be the opposite of this statement, and what would be other alternatives?"

**Writing Stories with AI**  
---
If you're into writing, AI can help with developing plots, creating characters, or structuring your story. 
It can serve as a source of inspiration or as an aid in overcoming creative blocks. 
Alternatively, it can review your written text and adjust the style, or pre-write similar content for a new topic.

**Example:**  
- "Help me develop this story about a protagonist who must choose between two paths."
- "What alternative endings could this story have?"
- "Here is the current chapter I have; I need a draft for the next one based on these criteria."

**Experimenting with New Narrative Forms**  
---
AI allows you to experiment

 with non-traditional narrative forms or unusual writing styles. You can ask it to convert a story into a script, 
 turn a poem into a short story, or experiment with narrative forms that are outside the norm.

**Example:**  
- "Can you rewrite this story as a screenplay?"
- "Transform this poem into a short story while keeping the main ideas."
- "What would this story look like if written in the first person?"

### 9.c Detailed Description of the Neural Network Training Process for Image Recognition

**Steps in Training AI for Image Identification**
---
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Collect a large number of images containing various objects.
   - Label the images with appropriate categories (e.g., "dog," "cat," "car").

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Normalize images (resize, scale pixel values).
   - Augment data (e.g., rotation, resizing, contrast changes) to increase model variability and robustness.

3. **Model Creation**:
   - Construct the architecture of the neural network, often using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition tasks.
   - Select model parameters, such as the number of layers, the number of filters in convolutional layers, and pooling layer sizes.

4. **Model Training**:
   - **Convolutional Layers**: Identify basic features of images, such as edges and contours.
   - **Pooling Layers**: Reduce dimensionality and extract more important textures and patterns. Types of pooling layers include max pooling and average pooling.
   - **Fully Connected Layers**: Integrate extracted features into higher abstract representations and make decisions about object categories.
   - **Activation Functions**: Use functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) to introduce non-linearity into the model.

5. **Validation and Testing**:
   - **Validation**: Test the model on a validation set that was not used during training to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
   - **Testing**: Evaluate the model's performance on completely new, unseen images to measure its ability to correctly identify objects.

6. **Model Optimization**:
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjust model parameters (e.g., learning rate, number of epochs, batch size) based on performance on the validation set.
   - **Regularization**: Use techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.

7. **Deployment and Usage**:
   - **Model Deployment**: Implement the model into a production environment where it can analyze new images and provide predictions.
   - **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Continuously monitor model performance and update based on new data or changing conditions.

8. **Feedback and Improvement**:
   - **Feedback**: Collect feedback on the model's performance in real-world applications.
   - **Improvement**: Further train and adjust the model based on feedback and new data.

**Data Quantity:**
---
- **Smaller Tasks:** For smaller tasks, such as training a model for a specific task, like recognizing a few specific objects, a few thousand images may be used. For instance, a dataset for specific applications like recognizing certain types of flowers or animals might consist of hundreds to several thousand images.
- **Standard Tasks:** For common image recognition tasks, such as image classification, tens to hundreds of thousands of images are used. For example, the popular ImageNet dataset, used for training modern image models, contains over 14 million images divided into more than 20,000 categories.
- **Large Tasks and Research:** For complex tasks involving a large number of diverse objects and scenarios, millions of images may be required. For instance, in training large models with broad generalization, such as those for autonomous vehicles, more than 10 million images might be used.

### 9.d Detailed Description of the Conversational AI Training Process

**Steps in Training Conversational AI**
---
1. **Data Collection and Preparation**:
   - **Data Collection**: Gather a large amount of text data containing various conversational patterns, such as dialogues, questions and answers, reviews, messages, and other relevant texts.
   - **Data Preprocessing**: Clean data from noise (e.g., remove irrelevant information), normalize text (e.g., convert to lowercase, remove special characters), and tokenize (split text into words or other language units).

2. **Model Creation**:
   - **Architecture Selection**: Construct the architecture of the neural network, usually based on transformers (e.g., GPT, BERT) for text processing. These architectures are designed to handle contextual and sequential information.
   - **Model Initialization**: Set initial model parameters, such as neuron weights.

3. **Model Training**:
   - **Supervised Training**: Train the model on pre-prepared question and answer data. The model learns to predict the next word or phrase in a sequence based on the context.
   - **Language Modeling**: The model learns to generate text that is coherent and relevant to the given context based on a vast amount of text data.
   - **Optimization**: Use optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam) to adjust model weights to minimize prediction error (loss function).

4. **Validation and Testing**:
   - **Validation**: Test the model on a validation set that was not used during training to monitor performance and prevent overfitting. This step includes assessing the coherence and relevance of generated responses.
   - **Testing**: Evaluate the model's performance on new, unseen data to determine its ability to generate accurate and contextually appropriate responses.

5. **Fine-tuning**:
   - **Fine-Tuning the Model**: Further train the model on specific data or for particular tasks (e.g., domain-specific or application-specific) to improve its performance in certain areas.
   - **Feedback Integration**: Incorporate user feedback for further model improvement, including correcting errors and enhancing accuracy.

6. **Deployment and Implementation**:
   - **Model Deployment**: Implement the model into a production environment where it can interact with users and provide responses based on current conversations.
   - **Scaling**: Ensure that the model can effectively handle a large number of users simultaneously.

7. **Monitoring and Maintenance**:
   - **Performance Monitoring**: Continuously monitor model performance in real-world applications, including analyzing interactions and evaluating response quality.
   - **Maintenance and Updates**: Regularly update the model based on new data and changing user requirements. This step involves retraining and fine-tuning the model according to current trends and demands.

8. **Feedback and Improvement**:
   - **Feedback Collection**: Gather information from users about their experiences with the AI, including their satisfaction and suggestions for improvement.
   - **Model Enhancement**: Use feedback to make adjustments and improvements to the model to ensure better response quality and an improved overall user experience.

**Data Quantity:**
---
- **Smaller Tasks:** For specific tasks or domain applications, a smaller data range may be used, such as a few hundred thousand conversational samples or dialogues. This might include, for example, a chatbot for a specific field, like customer support for a particular product.
- **Standard Tasks:** For broadly applicable conversational AI capable of general conversation, tens of millions of text samples are used. Models like GPT-3 were trained on extensive text corpora containing hundreds of billions of words. These datasets include diverse text sources like books, articles, websites, and other text documents.
- **Large Tasks and Research:** For advanced conversational models designed for universal text understanding and generation, such as GPT-4 or similar models, extensive and diverse text corpora are used, which may include over 300 billion words or even trillions of tokens. These datasets combine text from the internet, books, scientific articles, and other large text sources.

**9.f How This Manual Was Created**

**Record of the Conversation with ChatGPT During the Creation of This Document**
---
As a practical example of AI in action and a glimpse into the creation of this manual, 
I am including the full record of the conversation that served as the basis for this document. 
The manual was conceived from the start to have significant input from ChatGPT. 
My role was primarily to coordinate and oversee the entire process.

(The entire conversation is in Czech, so those who do not understand Czech will not be able to read it. 
The texts are intended for Czech-speaking users, and I have included this section 
with links mainly to provide a record of the individual steps and days.)

[August 16, 2024 - Creation of the outline and initial drafts of texts](24-08-16.md)  
[August 17, 2024 - Processing and editing the obtained texts](24-08-17.md)  
[August 18, 2024 - Creation of texts for the beginner's manual](24-08-18.md)  
[August 19, 2024 - Completion of texts and grammar correction for the beginner's manual](24-08-19.md)  
[August 20, 2024 - Final grammar correction and coherence check for the beginner's manual](24-08-20.md)  
[August 24, 2024 - Addition of texts for the main manual](24-08-24.md)  
[August 25, 2024 - Final editing of the beginner's manual](24-08-25.md)  
[August 26, 2024 - Final editing of the main manual](24-08-26.md)  
[August 27, 2024 - Translation of both manuals into English](24-08-27.md)  

The entire process took just under two weeks of my full involvement. 
Without ChatGPT, I would have faced significant challenges in gathering all the necessary data coherently. 
While it would have been possible to do it without it, it would have taken much longer, 
and it is likely that I would not have undertaken the task at all.

If you find this manual useful, I would like to emphasize ChatGPT's role in its development 
and express my gratitude to the developers and all the brilliant minds 
who contributed to the advancement of artificial intelligence (not just ChatGPT).

Thank you also to all of you for reading and for any feedback you may provide, 
and I wish you success in your life with AI as your helpful assistant.
