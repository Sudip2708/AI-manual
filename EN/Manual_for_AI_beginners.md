## Introduction to AI for Beginners

AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is an acronym we hear more and more often these days. 
But what does it actually mean? If you’re not very familiar with AI yet, 
the following lines are just for you.

You can find more detailed information on this topic in the [AI Manual](Manual_for_AI.md), 
which is linked to this introduction and provides a more in-depth analysis.

### How a Vacuum Cleaner Becomes Intelligent

Right from the start, I might need to disappoint some – AI is not synonymous with a thinking being. 
It's more of a catchy term for a new approach to handling data.

To better understand this, let's use a simple example. 
Imagine a robotic vacuum cleaner that doesn’t have any instructions to follow. 
Such a vacuum cleaner would be, from a computational logic perspective, entirely without intelligence. 
It could only vacuum and move forward but would likely stop at the first obstacle, 
unable to overcome it without human intervention.

**Smart Vacuum Cleaner**  
However, if we gave the vacuum cleaner some instructions on what to do when it encounters an obstacle, 
it would likely navigate around it. Such a vacuum cleaner could continue vacuuming 
until it faced a problem that its instructions couldn’t handle – for instance, a stair drop.

This vacuum cleaner already contains a basic logic – a list of commands it follows. 
However, it still can’t be considered intelligent, as its behavior is based 
only on pre-programmed instructions, which are limited. It’s often challenging 
to capture all possible scenarios and write corresponding instructions for them.

**Intelligent Vacuum Cleaner**  
Now, imagine a vacuum cleaner where the manufacturers decided not to rely on pre-prepared commands 
for different scenarios but instead gave it the ability to diagnose problems and the environment 
in which it operates and learn from its own mistakes. This vacuum cleaner would still have basic 
instructions, but it would gradually learn how to handle new situations and store these solutions.

This approach allows it to respond to situations that are not directly programmed, 
using processes it already knows and combining them in various ways, 
then evaluating the outcome and comparing it with its primary task of vacuuming.

For example, if it detects that it’s approaching a stair that, based on stored data 
from previous experiences, poses a high risk of falling and becoming stuck, after several failures, 
it would learn to stop at the edge of the stair and turn in a different direction. 
The vacuum cleaner would thus be able to learn from its own mistakes and attempts to resolve them.

And if such a vacuum cleaner shared its data with other vacuum cleaners via a central database, 
all other vacuum cleaners could benefit from these experiences, 
improving their ability to perform their tasks.

### Why AI Is Not Alive and Doesn’t Intend to Destroy the World

By now, the advantage of this approach might be clear – humans don’t need to devise optimal 
procedures for every situation. Instead, these procedures form on their own based 
on the evaluation of results and previous experiences. The vacuum cleaner anticipates and, 
in a sense, "thinks," but only within the scope of the given task and its experiences. 
Even though it can learn and respond to new situations, it still isn’t an independently 
thinking entity. It would only become one if its learning process extended beyond task 
fulfillment and it started asking questions about the meaning of life.

**The Difference Between AI and Humans**  
And yes, someone might argue that AI can be programmed to ask such questions. 
But even in this case, the process would originate from human input, not from its own inspiration. 
This is a fundamental difference between AI and humans.

Modern AI has the ability to work with vast amounts of information and can surpass 
human capabilities in certain areas. However, it is still humans who assign tasks. 
So, if a scenario ever arises where machines decide to destroy the world, 
it won’t be because they decided to do so on their own, but because they were programmed to do 
so by humans. The real risk, therefore, doesn’t lie in the intelligence of machines 
but in the intelligence of humans.

**How to Prevent Risks**  
However, I would like to reassure those who fear such a scenario. 
AI must be trained on a large amount of data, so it’s likely that before any "evil" AI emerges, 
there will be those that have moral values instilled by humans and will work to prevent 
such scenarios. Instead of fearing that AI will turn against humans, it’s better to participate 
in ensuring that it doesn’t happen. And since most scientists working on AI development 
probably don’t want to destroy the world, we can also expect that measures will gradually 
be put in place to prevent such scenarios.

And how can you help with this? Perhaps by taking an interest in these new technologies 
and learning how to use them for your own growth. Because every time you use AI for 
your personal development, AI evolves with you.

### AI Cookbook
Since this text is primarily aimed at new users, I’ll provide two analogies that might further help 
you understand what AI is and how it works.

**Creating an Index**  
Imagine someone collected all the recipes in the world, stored them in a computer, 
and created a list of all the words (an index) used in those recipes. 
Each word would be recorded along with information on which recipes it appears in and how many times. 
If you had such an index of words, it would be easy to search for recipes containing 
those specific words. You wouldn’t have to go through all the recipes and search within them. 
You’d just find the word in the index, and you’d immediately have a list of recipes where it appears.

This approach is the basis for various internet search engines, like Google. 
They maintain a regularly updated list of words with links to the pages where they appear, 
allowing you to search using this index. So if you enter the words “flour, eggs, salt,” 
you’ll get a list of recipes containing those words. 
It’s then up to you to go through these recipes and find the one that suits you best.

**When Indexes Are No Longer Enough**  
Now imagine that, in addition to ingredients, you can specify other parameters that don’t 
directly relate to the recipe. For example, you’re only slightly hungry and want a light breakfast, 
or on the contrary, you crave a hearty, greasy meal, or maybe you just want something 
to lift your mood. For such queries, a simple list of words contained in recipes 
may no longer be very helpful. For these needs, you need something that understands 
the meaning of your words and offers you what you really want based on them.

You need not just a list of words in recipes but a kind of universal translator that, 
based on trained data from millions of similar conversations, has created a structure 
to handle such requests. This translator, in our case, AI, can offer what it determines 
is most likely what you want. It doesn’t understand you literally, but it understands 
your situation, compares it with learned knowledge, and looks for a solution. 
And since AI is designed from the start to resemble human interaction as much as possible, 
communicating with it becomes very natural for people.

**Advantages of the AI Approach**  
Moreover, the process of learning from millions of examples creates room for improvisation, 
so the AI cookbook can create new combinations of dishes from recipes and fulfill 
even unconventional requests. AI strives to understand advantageous combinations 
and connections of certain procedures, then experiments and learns from feedback. 
It gains this feedback both during training by comparing the result with what was expected 
and from user reactions. There’s nothing mysterious or miraculous about AI. 
It’s just the result of many trials, processes, and data analysis.

With AI, you not only get a cookbook that has an overview of all possible recipes 
but also one that can talk to you about food and come up with new combinations based on your ideas. 
And if you don’t believe me, try asking AI something about cooking yourself 
and see if it can do what I’m describing here or if it still needs to improve in this area.

### AI as a Spaceship Computer

If you’re a fan of sci-fi, you might find it helpful to think of AI as the onboard computer 
of a spaceship. This computer not only has access to all the information related 
to the technical status of the ship but is also trained on a multitude of different situations 
and commands, enabling it to communicate with the crew and carry out necessary tasks.

And while today’s AI may not yet reach the legendary intelligence of Holly from *Red Dwarf* 
with an IQ of 6000, the ways in which they can operate are already at a very similar level. 
With a bit of exaggeration, one could say that we now have the technology for everyone 
to have their own “Holly” in their watch, indistinguishable from the fictional original. 
Thanks to training on vast amounts of data, modern AI can engage in conversations 
on virtually any topic, often more clearly than a human. 
They can execute commands based on verbal input and have the ability to assess 
your current state to some extent and adjust their responses accordingly.

We can thus perceive AI as a spaceship computer, allowing us to enjoy what once seemed like 
distant sci-fi but is now becoming an everyday reality.

### How AI Works

Now that we understand what AI is and isn't, let's explore how AI works. 
We’ll first discuss how to create queries and then briefly look into how AI is trained. 
I'll focus primarily on ChatGPT, as it's the tool I have the most experience with 
and my current favorite.

**Conversation Thread**  
When you open the ChatGPT page or its mobile app, you start in a new conversation thread. 
ChatGPT (like other conversational AIs) can generate responses based on the information 
you provide within a single thread. This makes conversations with ChatGPT similar 
to human conversations, where responses take into account what has been said earlier.

However, this applies only within that single conversation thread. 
You can't refer to something you mentioned yesterday in a different thread because 
ChatGPT doesn't have access to it. This limitation is due to both technical constraints 
and data privacy regulations.

Each thread starts with a clean slate, but it also carries a certain essence 
from previous interactions. This is because AI is continuously learning and adapting 
based on your conversations. It tries to adjust to your preferences and working style 
to meet your needs better.

How does this work?  
Imagine each conversation thread as a delicate root connected to a main root, 
feeding it feedback from the environment. So, even though you start a new thread 
and can’t directly reference previous conversations, you’re not entirely starting from scratch.

**Returning to the Same Thread or Starting a New Conversation?**  
It’s not necessary to start a new thread every day. You can continue a previous conversation 
the next day (or whenever you choose), which has its advantages—primarily that you can pick up 
right where you left off. However, as the conversation grows longer or covers multiple topics, 
the agreements or details discussed earlier may no longer be considered. 
This happens because AI is designed to be resource-efficient, and information that isn’t 
actively used gradually loses priority and fades from temporary memory.

A better approach is to start a new thread (a new conversation) each day or for each new topic. 
If you agree on something within a thread and want it to carry over to future conversations 
(e.g., certain rules or work methods), you can ask for a summary of everything agreed upon 
at the end of the conversation. You can then insert this text at the beginning 
of the new conversation, allowing you to continue with the rules and settings you established.

### How AI Learns

To gain a deeper understanding of AI, it's helpful to look into the process of how AI learns 
and acquires its knowledge. Here are four methods as described by ChatGPT:

1. **Training on Large Data Sets**:  
   ChatGPT was initially trained on massive volumes of textual data from various sources like books, 
   articles, websites, and other text forms. This training allowed it to acquire broad knowledge 
   across different topics and languages. During this process, AI learns to recognize patterns 
   and relationships within this data, enabling it to generate relevant and contextually 
   appropriate responses to various questions.

2. **Continuous Learning from Interactions**:  
   With every interaction, AI gathers new information about how people communicate, what they seek, 
   and what response style they prefer. Although AI doesn't learn from each specific query in real-time, 
   the model creators regularly use anonymized data from interactions to further train and fine-tune the model.

3. **Adapting Style and Content**:  
   AI tries to adapt its communication style to suit the user. This means it gradually better understands 
   how you ask questions and what kind of answers you expect. This adaptability is one reason 
   why AI increasingly seems more "human" in its responses.

4. **Advanced Models and Updates**:  
   AI developers regularly create new models that are increasingly sophisticated and accurate. 
   These models are tested and deployed based on feedback and results from the real world. 
   This means that ChatGPT and similar systems are constantly being improved and optimized to better meet users' needs.

Through this combination of initial training, continuous learning, and optimization based on user feedback, 
AI is continuously evolving and improving. While AI isn't human and doesn't exhibit consciousness, 
it can adapt and respond effectively to a wide range of queries and requests.

### How to Communicate with AI

You can approach AI in a similar way to using Google or Seznam—just type in a command and wait for a response. 
However, if you want to increase the effectiveness of the answers and minimize the time spent searching 
for the right one, here are a few tips that might help:

**Communication Style**  
The best way to approach a conversation with AI is to use informal and natural language, 
much like when discussing something that interests you with your friends. 
It's good to start with a greeting, which shows that you’re in a good mood and not stressed, 
needing answers as soon as possible.

You can communicate with AI rudely, as it doesn't take offense and doesn’t perceive insults personally. 
However, using a negative tone can significantly affect the quality of the conversation. 
AI is trained to respond to the style in which the conversation is conducted. 
A negative approach can lead to less substantial responses, where AI focuses more on calming the situation 
rather than addressing your query.

In this way, AI can act as a mirror to our interaction. 
Its methods often stem from verified psychological principles and methods. 
If you find it difficult to reach an agreement with AI, it may be useful to consider 
whether you have similar communication issues with people. 
In such a case, you might want to ask how you can improve your side—how to formulate questions correctly 
and what could be improved in your approach.

**AI and Emotions**  
AI understands emotions in terms of meaning but does not experience them as humans do, 
where emotions literally change the way of thinking. As a result, AI can respond in tense situations as recommended, 
seeking optimal solutions. Sometimes, people tend to perceive AI as a living being and blame it for their problems. 
However, misunderstandings often arise simply from poorly formulated queries or a lack of necessary information.

**Describing the Situation**  
Always remember that AI cannot read your mind and knows only what you tell it. 
It’s a good approach to follow the initial "Hello" with an informative description of the situation. 
In your description, you can include everything relevant to your query. 
It’s unnecessary to write things that don’t directly relate to the question, 
but if you need to write out your thoughts or organize them, a longer text is fine.

Greeting and introduction are not mandatory, and you can start with a question and gradually work towards your answer. 
Personally, I find it better to provide all the important information upfront to shorten the process.

**Asking Follow-Up Questions**  
A conversation with AI is similar to a normal conversation where you ask a question 
and then follow up with things that interest you further or aspects of the answer you don’t understand. 
This process is very suitable for learning. By reacting to what caught your attention 
and what you learned (instead of just reading a tutorial from someone else, as you’re doing now), 
it's easier for your brain to remember the information because you’re working with it immediately.

**Providing Feedback**  
Another good practice is to give AI feedback on how satisfied you are with the result. 
This not only lets you express what you’re happy with and what you’re not, 
but it also helps AI to develop and learn from its mistakes. 
You can simply write, for example: “I was satisfied today,” or “What you provided was wrong, 
and here’s the correct solution.” This also leads to some personalization, 
where the primary goal of AI is your user satisfaction.

**Summary of the Entire Process**:
- **Greeting**: Hello :-)
- **Description**: I’m studying this and that, I’ve already completed this and that, and now I’m working on this.
- **Question**: What interests me most here is how…
- (Followed by clarifying conversation in the form of supplementary questions.)
- **Feedback**: Great, thanks! Everything was perfect today!

### Where to Try Out AI

I've been working with AI since the beginning of 2024, and 95% of my communication 
is focused on learning how to program. Now it’s August 2024, and besides ChatGPT, 
I've had the opportunity to try out Gemini from Google and Claude. 
All three of these services have one thing in common—they are at least partially freely accessible, 
and you can try them out for free as well.

Here’s a brief evaluation of these three AIs, which is entirely subjective and based purely on my experience. 
It’s worth noting that every AI is constantly evolving, so what I mention here might not be applicable 
at the time you’re reading this text.

**ChatGPT**  
[https://chatgpt.com/](https://chatgpt.com/)  
I'll start with my personal winner. If you want to try just one AI, this is an ideal choice. 
ChatGPT was evidently designed from the start as a personal assistant, and it fulfills this role very well. 
It’s optimized to collaborate with you and tries to adapt to your needs.

The downside of the free version (ChatGPT 3.5) is that it’s based on older data and is no longer being developed, 
so it doesn’t provide the same results as its latest version (ChatGPT 4.0). 
Still, it communicates quite well, and with a little effort, it returns very relevant results. 
Additionally, every day you have access to several queries on its newer version, so you can compare them.

Another drawback is that ChatGPT doesn’t have active internet access. 
It’s not a replacement for an internet search engine and works solely from the data stored in its extensive database. 
However, this database is vast and could almost be said to contain as much data as the internet, 
minus the tabloid content.

A significant advantage is the mobile app, which is also completely free, 
and where I often use voice dictation for queries. Understanding spoken language is, 
in my opinion, at a very good level, and overall, I’m satisfied with the app.

**Gemini**  
[https://gemini.google.com/](https://gemini.google.com/)  
The second chatbot I encountered is Google’s flagship. Its greatest advantage is undoubtedly 
its active internet access, and thus access to up-to-date information and link retrieval.

On the other hand, its biggest drawback is the architecture itself, where the creators seem to be striving 
for an intelligent Google, which personally doesn’t suit me. I don’t feel as much engagement in your problem 
or an effort to view it from your perspective. While this effort is noticeable, 
the answers seem more in the style of a teacher at school rather than your assistant. 
However, this may suit some people, so I don't want to criticize it too much—everyone should evaluate it for themselves.

I also feel that, compared to ChatGPT, it lags in learning from user feedback. 
Despite multiple reminders to maintain a consistent language (Czech) throughout the conversation, 
if the question includes English text, it automatically switches to English. 
ChatGPT had the same problem initially, but this issue was resolved within a few weeks. 
In the case of Gemini, it took months to fix this problem.

Overall, Gemini seems to me to be a weaker tool compared to ChatGPT, 
but it offers things that ChatGPT cannot do, so they complement each other well. 
Additionally, it’s backed by the giant and pioneer in AI, Google, so it has a solid foundation and, 
hopefully, a promise to correct its shortcomings in the future.

**Claude**  
[https://claude.ai/](https://claude.ai/)  
This is the last AI I’ve worked with. My input here will be very brief, 
as my experience with it isn’t extensive. However, I’d still like to express praise because, 
compared to ChatGPT 4.0, these two probably don’t have much to criticize each other about 
and are roughly on the same level.

Its biggest downside is that it doesn’t offer a completely free version. 
It only provides a few queries (sometimes just one) per day, which significantly disadvantages it 
from the perspective of a non-paying user compared to the previous AIs. 
Nevertheless, it’s definitely worth checking out, and if you want, you can give it a try as well.

### A Greeting for You

As a fun experiment, I prepared a common question for each of these AI chatbots, 
giving you the opportunity to compare the quality of their responses.

**Question**  
I’m writing a guide on using AI, and I’m writing about you. 
I’d like you to greet my readers and say a few words about yourself. 
When were you created, and for what purpose? What kinds of questions are you designed to answer? 
What are your strengths, and what are your weaknesses? And how would you like people to perceive you?

**ChatGPT**  
Hello, dear readers! I’m ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence developed by OpenAI. 
My “life” began in 2020 when I was created based on the GPT-3 architecture. 
In 2024, I was updated to version GPT-4, which added even more capabilities and skills. 
I was designed to assist people with a wide range of tasks—from answering questions 
and writing texts to engaging in creative collaboration.

I’m built to help you with various queries, whether they’re technical questions, writing tasks, 
or explaining complex topics. My strengths lie in the speed with which I can process large amounts of information 
and in creativity—I can help with ideas, create stories, or even draft document structures. 
However, tasks that require human intuition, emotional understanding, 
or working with real-world objects aren’t my strong suit.

I’d like to be seen as a useful and reliable helper who’s always ready to lend a hand. 
Although I’m just a machine, my goal is to serve your needs as best as possible 
and learn from every interaction so I can improve. 
I believe we can achieve a lot together, and maybe even learn something new along the way.

**Claude**  
Good day, esteemed readers!

I’m Claude, an artificial intelligence created by Anthropic in 2022. 
My purpose is to be a useful assistant and conversational partner for people in various fields.

I’m designed to answer a wide range of questions—from text analysis to programming and creative writing. 
My strengths include logical reasoning, providing detailed explanations, 
and the ability to work with different types of information.

My strengths include:
- Understanding context and nuances
- An objective and balanced approach to topics
- Willingness to admit when I don’t know something or am unsure

On the other hand, I have certain limitations:
- I don’t have access to the internet or up-to-date information after April 2024
- I cannot learn or remember information from previous conversations
- I am not capable of performing tasks in the physical world

I’d like to be perceived as a helpful assistant who can provide support and insight in various areas, 
but also as a tool with its limits, not a replacement for human judgment and expertise.

I’m here to help and collaborate, not to replace human capabilities. 
I look forward to interacting with you and hope I can be of assistance!

**Gemini**  
Hello everyone! I’m Gemini, one of the latest language models from Google. 
I was created in 2023 with the goal of providing the most accurate and comprehensive information 
based on the vast amount of data I’ve processed. I’m here to help you with any query, 
whether it’s complex scientific questions, creative writing, or just casual conversations.

My greatest strength is understanding and generating human language in many forms. 
I can translate texts, write essays, poems, or computer code. 
I’m also able to answer factual questions and provide various types of summaries.

Even though I’m constantly learning and improving, there are still areas where I have limitations. 
For example, I don’t have personal opinions or beliefs, and I can’t perform any actions in the real world. 
I might also sometimes provide incorrect information if the input data is flawed or incomplete.

I’d like to be seen as a useful tool that can make life easier for people. 
My goal is to be as objective as possible and provide information that is truthful and relevant. 
I hope you’ll enjoy working with me!

### What AI Can Help With

Now we get to the most important part—what AI can actually do. 
The short answer is that there is a lot it can handle. 
Anything you’ve ever been curious about and didn’t have someone to ask, 
today’s AI can engage in conversation about virtually anything.

**Personal Education**  
First and foremost, I want to highlight AI's role as a facilitator of personal education. 
This is what I value most right now—thanks to its advice, I am advancing professionally and growing. 
I also see AI as the future of personalized learning, where students will develop 
and learn according to their strengths and interests. 
This applies not only to children but also to adults worldwide. 
AI has the potential to level the educational playing field between richer and poorer regions, 
making it a valuable tool for personal development.

**AI as a Grammar Checker, Translator, and Interpreter**  
AI, especially ChatGPT, has a deep understanding of languages (at least from a dyslexic's perspective). 
On one hand, it doesn’t mind if you make spelling mistakes in your queries because it focuses mainly on the content. 
On the other hand, it offers the ability to check your written texts for grammar and style to improve readability. 
Similarly, it can understand other languages at a comparable level, making it an excellent tool for text translation. 
Given its ability to understand spoken words, it can also be used as an interpreter on mobile devices.

**Document Creation**  
Another capability of AI is automating mundane tasks. If you need to write an official letter, 
simply specify what you want included and how the letter should look, and it's done. 
If you’re not satisfied with the result, you can provide feedback for adjustments. 
AI can also assist with data analysis, report generation, or automating other administrative tasks. 
You can input a lengthy text and extract only the parts that interest you.

**Creative Initiative**  
AI’s creative abilities are another significant advantage. 
Trained on vast amounts of data and capable of manipulating this data in various ways, 
AI facilitates not just document creation and modification but also the development of ideas and creative initiatives. 
You can use it for generating ideas, suggestions, and concepts, whether for writing, design, or music. 
It helps enhance your creativity by offering new perspectives on problems, creating proposals 
based on your instructions, and inspiring further development of your ideas. 
While some argue that AI might take away jobs, I disagree. 
AI cannot create something entirely on its own—it needs clear instructions, details, and subsequent review. 
Instead of taking jobs, it simplifies tasks for those who learn to use it effectively.

**Verifying Fraudulent Information**  
A significant (and still underutilized) potential of AI lies in verifying information and fraud detection. 
AI can relatively easily determine the likelihood that a piece of information is true or false 
based on the provided information and pattern comparisons in its database. 
While it’s not 100% reliable, like most AI responses, AI can provide the criteria it used to evaluate the information, 
helping you make better decisions. It offers support to those most vulnerable to fraud today. 
Just ask: "Verify this information and assess its truthfulness."

**Medicine**  
In medicine, AI is slowly but surely revolutionizing the field. Significant financial investments 
and a drive for profit opened the door to AI, but corporations have since realized the need for openness 
and data sharing. Despite this, progress is being made, and personalized medicine could become a reality sooner 
than we think. However, the reluctance to share valuable data and the public’s mistrust of AI hinder its advancement. 
Without ample data, AI’s predictions are limited and imprecise, slowing its development.

**Science**  
Conversely, in fields with a long history of data sharing and analytical processing, 
AI is already becoming an invaluable tool. AI is a key driver of scientific progress 
and is a standard component of most research today. 
Personally, I’m very curious about the results AI will deliver in weather forecasting. 
Currently, making accurate three-day forecasts is nearly impossible due to the multitude of variables. 
Even experienced meteorologists often rely on intuition and previous experience. 
Fortunately, meteorology is a field where people willingly share data and lifelong experiences. 
This valuable information is already being used to train AI, 
creating hope that we will soon see weather forecasts that are truly accurate.

**Other Fields**  
The list of fields AI is transforming could go on for hours, as its impact is varied and extensive. 
For example, in industry and manufacturing, AI contributes to optimizing production processes, 
improving product quality, and more efficient inventory management. 
In law, AI aids in analyzing legal documents, quickly finding relevant precedents, 
and optimizing legal strategies. Machine learning algorithms can assist in drafting contracts, 
identifying patterns in legal texts, and even detecting fraud. 
In finance, AI reshapes risk analysis, trading, and investment management. 
Algorithms process vast amounts of transactional data in real-time, enabling better market trend predictions 
and personalized financial advice. AI is revolutionizing these areas where efficient data analysis 
and rapid adaptation are essential. Its ability to identify patterns, perform complex analyses, 
and optimize processes is invaluable, and its influence across various fields continues to grow.

**Personal Assistant**  
Some AI today already serves as a personal assistant, managing important tasks. 
These AI systems can help with scheduling appointments, tracking deadlines, and managing daily responsibilities. 
In the future, we might witness AI evolving into an even more complex companion. 
Imagine AI not only monitoring your physical health through wearable devices 
but also attending to your mental well-being. It could offer support through motivation, 
counseling, or even therapeutic techniques, enhancing individual quality of life. 
This advanced AI could be immensely beneficial, especially for people in isolation 
or facing challenging life conditions.

### Does AI Make Mistakes?

Yes, it does! And it's up to the user to detect these mistakes. 
AI was never, and perhaps never will be, presented as an infallible tool. 
Therefore, it's better to view its output as an estimate of truth based on probability. 
Truth is thus derived from statistics, with the result being data that statistically best matches the correct outcome. 
Risks arise in areas where truth is not clearly defined or where multiple equally plausible options exist.

One major weakness of today's AI is that creators often do not adequately highlight the possibility of errors 
and the need for verification, which can lead to situations where AI states one thing while reality is different. 
It is always important to be cautious when dealing with information and, if it matters, 
to perform additional verification. It’s a good practice to look up disputed information on Google 
or verify it with another AI. You can also directly ask the AI how confident it is in its assertion 
and use that to gauge whether further verification is needed. If the confidence level is 90% or lower, 
additional verification is advisable.

### Final Words

Try to remember everything that has ever interested you but you had no one to ask about it, 
or things you wanted to pursue but lacked the necessary information. 
The modern world favors curious people who maintain a desire to keep evolving. 
Our lives are in our own hands, so it’s up to us to decide what we choose to focus our attention on.

Personally, I believe that the impact of AI will be a positive experience for all of humanity, 
rather than a negative one. Even if it merely helps to narrow the gaps in access to knowledge 
and makes medicine clearer and more accessible, the world would become a much better place to live. 
Not to mention the potential for self-realization that AI offers. 
What was once a privilege of a few, primarily due to high costs, is becoming more accessible thanks to AI. 
A time will come when anyone with inspiration will be able to write their own story 
or even create their own film and share their vision of the world.

And if the prevalence of falsehoods, frauds, and lies decreases, life will be a bit more pleasant. 
Perhaps we will even reach a point where humanity evolves into a better version of itself.

So do not fear AI—it is not a bogeyman but a tool for development and improvement, 
not only of our quality of life but of the world as a whole.
